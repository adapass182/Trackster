# Trackster
First app using the Spotify API

Clone the repo and run yarn to get dependencies. cd to /login and run node app.js to start auth server, cd to /client and run yarn start to start dev server.
client_id, client_secret and redirect uri are kept separate from github for privacy, message me for a demo!
